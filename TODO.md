## High Priority
* make sure to delete pythondaemon on all versions prior to 1.4
* rename the nafsdm-master executable to nafsdm-manager everywhere
* migrate SQL file to new format on update
* update wikis and all readme's/howto's
* nafsdmctl zone editor
* editor for zones managed by nafsdm inside of webinterface
* remove domains no longer managed by nafsdm-daemon

## Lower Priority
* rework the master
